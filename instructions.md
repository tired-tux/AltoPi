# Steps to Follow
1. Download the image and flash it to your SD card of choice. Set off to side.
2. 3D print all of the STL files in any color you want (or you could make it match the tin color!).
3. Grab the [Outside Stencil](stls/outside_stencil.stl) and your drill with a small drill bit.
4. Put the stencil on the bottom of your tin and drill in the places where the ports and sensors will be (Be very careful NOT to drill into the 3D printed part!).
5. Place Electrical Tape on the inside of the tin.
6. Lay the tin down so the hinge is at a 180 Degree angle.
7. Place the display in the top of the tin and secure with some glue.
8. Put the 3D printed part in the top of the tin with some glue.
